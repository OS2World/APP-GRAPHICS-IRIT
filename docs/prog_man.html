<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>  Programmers' Manual - IRIT </H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER> Introduction </H2>

This manual describes the different libraries of the IRIT solid
modeling environment. Quite a few libraries can be found to manipulate
geometry in general, freeform curves and surfaces, symbolic
computation, trimmed surfaces, triangular patches, freeform trivariate
functions, Boolean operations, input output data file parsing, and
miscelleneous.<BR><BR>

All interface to the libraries should be made via the appropriate header
files that can be found in the include subdirectory. Most libraries
have a single header file that is named the same as the library.
Functions and constants that are visible to the users of the libraries
are prefixed with a unique prefix, usually derived from the library
name itself. External definitions that start with an underscore should
not be used, even if found in header files.<BR><BR>

The header file <B> include/irit_sm.h </B> must be sourced by every
source file in the solid modeller. In most cases, this file is sourced
indirectly via local header files.<BR><BR>

The following libraries are avaliable in IRIT:<BR><BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> Tools and Programs </H3>

The IRIT package includes several complete programs such as poly3d-h
(hidden line removal), irender (scan conversion tool), and irit2ps (a
filter to Postscript).  Somewhat different than most other programs is
the kernel interpreter, also called irit.  The irit program is nothing
more than an interpreter (written in C) that invokes numerous
functions in the several libraries provided.  In order to add a new
function to the irit interpreter, the following sequence of operations
must be followed:

<TABLE BORDER=7 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TH align=left> 
    Write a C function that accepts only one or more of the following
     type of parameters.  All parameters, including the IrtRType, <B> must </B>
     be transferred by address:
     <TABLE BORDER=7 CELLPADDING=1>
	<TR><TH align=left> IrtRType         (see irit_sm.h).
	<TR><TH align=left> IrtVecType       (see irit_sm.h).
	<TR><TH align=left> IrtPtType        (see irit_sm.h).
	<TR><TH align=left> CagdCtlPtStruct  (see cagd_lib.h).
	<TR><TH align=left> IrtPlnType       (see irit_sm.h).
	<TR><TH align=left> StringType       (char *).
	<TR><TH align=left> IPObjectStruct   (see iritprsr.h).  This
		 includes all object
		types in IPObjectStruct other than the above.
    </TABLE>
<TR><TH align=left>  The written C function can return one of:
    <TABLE BORDER=7 CELLPADDING=1>
	<TR><TH align=left>  IrtRType by value.
	<TR><TH align=left>  IPObjectStruct by address.
	<TR><TH align=left>  Nothing (a procedure).
    </TABLE>
<TR><TH align=left>  According to the returned type by the new C function,

	go to file
	<B> inptprsl.h </B>, and add a new enum NEW_FUNC for the new
	function in enum RealValueFuncType (for IrtRType returned value), in
	enum ObjValueFuncType (for IPObjectStruct * returned value),
	or in enum GenValueFuncType (for no returned value).
<TR><TH align=left>  In <B> inptevl1.c </B>, add one new line in one of
	NumFuncTable,
	ObjFuncTable, or GenFuncTable (depends upon the return value).
	The line will have the form of:
	<PRE>
            { ``FuncName'', NEW_FUNC, CFunctionName,  N, { Param1Type,
                                              Param2Type, ... ParamNType } }
	</PRE>
	for procedures with no return values, and of the form of:
	<PRE>
            { ``FuncName'', NEW_FUNC, CFunctionName,  N, { Param1Type,
                                    Param2Type, ... ParamNType }, RetValType }
	</PRE>
	otherwise. N is the number of parameters,
	``FuncName'' is the (unique) name that will be used in
	the interpreter, CFunctionName is the name of the C function you
	have written. This C function must be declared in one of the header
	files that inptevl1.c includes. ParamIType, for I between 1 and N,
	and RetValType are of type IritExprType (see inptprsl.h).
<TR><TH align=left>  Thats it!
</TABLE>

For example, to add the C function declared as
<PRE>
    IPObjectStruct *PolyhedraMoments(IPObjectStruct *IPObjectStruct, IrtRType *m);
</PRE>
one has to add the following line to ObjFuncTable in iritevl1.c
<PRE>
    { ``PMOMENT'', PMOMENT, { POLY_EXPR, REAL_EXPR }, VECTOR_EXPR },
</PRE>
where PMOMENT needs to be added to ObjValueFuncType in iritprsl.h.

While all objects in the interpreted space are of type IPObjectStruct,
the functions' interface unfolds many types to simplify matter.
IrtRType, IrtVecType, Strings, etc. are all extracted from the given
(IPObjectStruct) parameters and passed directly by address.  For
returned values, only numeric real data is allowed where everything
else must be returned wrapped in an IPObjectStruct.

<!##########################################################################>

The following chapters reference the different function of different
libraries. Chapter~ref{chap-examples} provides several examples of
writing C code using the IRIT libraries.<BR><BR>

<!##########################################################################>

<HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER> Boolean Library, bool_lib </H2>

<H3> General Information </H3>

On of the crucial operation in any solid modeling environment is the
ability to perform Boolean operations among different geometric
objects.  The interface of the library is defined in
include/bool_lib.h. This library supports only Boolean operations of
polygonal objects. The Boolean operations of OR, AND, SUBtract,
NEGate, CUT, and MERGE are supported via the BoolOperType typedef:
<TABLE BORDER=7 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TH align=left> BoolOperType <TH align=left> Meaning
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_OR <TH align=left> Union of two geometrical objects
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_AND <TH align=left> Intersection of two geometrical objects
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_SUB <TH align=left> The difference of two geometrical objects
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_NEG <TH align=left> Unary Inside-out of one geometrical object
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_CUT <TH align=left> Boundary of one object outside the other
<TR><TH align=left> BOOL_OPER_MERGE <TH align=left> Simple merge without any computation
</TABLE>

The <B> BoolOperType </B> typedef is used in two dimensional Boolean operations
invoked via <B> Boolean2D </B>. Three dimensional Boolean operations are
invoked via <B> BooleanXXX </B> where XXX is one of OR, AND, SUB, NEG, CUT
or MERGE, denoting the same as in the table above.

In addition several state functions are available to control the way
the Boolean operations are conducted. Functions to enable the dump of
(only) the intersection curves, to handle coplanar polygons, and to
set the axis along which the sweep is performed are provided.

<!##########################################################################>

<HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER> CAGD Library, cagd_lib </H2>

<H3> General Information </H3>

This library provides a rich set of function to create, convert,
display and process freeform Bezier and NURBs curves and surfaces. The
interface of the library is defined in <B> include/cagd_lib.h </B>. This
library mainly supports low level freeform curve and surface
operations.  Supported are curves and surfaces from scalars to five
dimensions as E1/P1 to E5/P5 using the <B> CagdPointType </B>. Pi is a
rational (projective) version of Ei, with an additional W coefficient.
Polynomial in the power basis have some very limited support as well.
Different data structures to hold UV parameter values, control points,
vectors, planes, bounding boxes, polylines and polygons are defined as
well as the data strcutures to hold the curves and surfaces
themselves,<BR><BR>
<B><PRE>
typedef struct CagdCrvStruct {
    struct CagdCrvStruct *Pnext;
    struct IPAttributeStruct *Attr;
    CagdGeomType GType;
    CagdPointType PType;
    int Length;            /* Number of control points (== order in Bezier). */
    int Order;	    /* Order of curve (only for Bspline, ignored in Bezier). */
    CagdBType Periodic;			   /* Valid only for Bspline curves. */
    CagdRType *Points[CAGD_MAX_PT_SIZE];     /* Pointer on each axis vector. */
    CagdRType *KnotVector;
} CagdCrvStruct;

typedef struct CagdSrfStruct {
    struct CagdSrfStruct *Pnext;
    struct IPAttributeStruct *Attr;
    CagdGeomType GType;
    CagdPointType PType;
    int ULength, VLength;	 /* Mesh size in the tensor product surface. */
    int UOrder, VOrder;   /* Order in tensor product surface (Bspline only). */
    CagdBType UPeriodic, VPeriodic;      /* Valid only for Bspline surfaces. */
    CagdRType *Points[CAGD_MAX_PT_SIZE];     /* Pointer on each axis vector. */
    CagdRType *UKnotVector, *VKnotVector;
} CagdSrfStruct;
</PRE></B>

Curves and surfaces have a geometric type <B> GType </B> to prescribe the
type of entity (such as CAGD_SBEZIER_TYPE for Bezier surface) and a
point type <B> PType </B> to prescribe the point type of the entity (such
as CAGD_PT_E3_TYPE for three dimensional Euclidean control points).
<B> Length </B> and <B> Order </B> slots are used to hold the number of
control points in the mesh and or control polygon and the order(s) of
the basis functions. <B> Periodic </B> flag(s) are used to denote
periodic end conditions. In addition, <B> KnotVector </B> slot(s) are
used if the entity exploits Bspline basis functions, or NULL
otherwise.

The control polygon and/or mesh itself is organized in the <B>
Points </B> slot as a vector of size <B> CAGD_MAX_PT_SIZE </B> of vectors
of <B> CagdRType </B>s. For surfaces, the mesh is ordered U first and the
macros of <B> CAGD_NEXT_U </B> <B> CAGD_NEXT_V </B>, and <B>
CAGD_MESH_UV </B> can be used to determine indices in the mesh.

All structures in the cagd library can be allocated using New
constrcutures (i.e. <B> CagdUVNew </B> or <B> CagdCrfNew </B>, freed using
Free destructores (i.e. <B> CagdSrfFree </B> or {CagdBBoxFree}, linked
list free using FreeList destructores (i.e. <B>
CagdPolylineFreeList </B>), and copied using copy constructores {i.e. <B>
CagdPtCopy </B> or <B> CagdCtlPtCopyList </B>).

This library has its own error handler, which by default prints an
error message and exit the program called <B> CagdFatalError </B>.

Most globals in this library have a prefix of <B> Cagd </B> for general
cagd routines. Prefix of <B> Bzr </B> is used for Bezier routines, prefix
of <B> Bsp </B> for Bspline specific routines, prefix of <B> Cnvrt </B> for
conversion routines, and <B> Afd </B> for adaptive forward differencing
routines.

<HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER> Programming Examples </H2>

This chapter describes several simple examples of C programs that
exploits the libraries of IRIT. All external function are defined in
the <B> include </B> subdirectory of IRIT and one can 'grep' there for the
exact include file that contains a certain function name. All C programs
in all C files should include 'irit_sm.h' as their first include file
of IRIT, before any other include file of IRIT. Header files are set so
C++ code can compile and link to it without any special treatment.

<H3> Setting up the Compilation Environment </H3>

In order to compile programs that uses the libraries of IRIT, a makefile
has to be constructed. Assuming IRIT is installed in <B> /usr/local/irit </B>,
here is a simple makefile that can be used (for a unix environment):

<B><PRE>
IRIT_DIR = /usr/local/irit

include $(IRIT_DIR)/makeflag.unx

OBJS	= program.o

program: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o program $(OBJS) $(LIBS) -lm $(MORELIBS)
</PRE></B>

The simplicity of this makefile is drawn from the complexity of
makeflag.unx. The file makeflag.unx sets the CC, CFLAGS, LIBS, and
MORELIBS for the machined using among other things. Furthermore,
makeflag.unx also sets the default compilation rules from C sources to
object files.  The file makeflag.unx had to be modified once, when
IRIT was installed on this system. If the used system is not a unix
environment, then the file makefile.unx will have to be replaced with
the proper makeflag file.  In an OS2 environment, using the emx gcc
compiler, the makefile is even simpler since the linking rule is also
defined in makeflag.os2:

<B><PRE>
IRIT_DIR = /usr/local/irit

include $(IRIT_DIR)/makeflag.os2

OBJS	= program.o

program.exe: $(OBJS)
</PRE></B>

Finally, here is a proper makefile for Windows NT/ Win 95:

<B><PRE>
IRIT_DIR = /usr/local/irit

include $(IRIT_DIR)/makeflag.wnt

OBJS	= program.obj

program.exe: $(OBJS)
        $(IRITCONLINK) -out:program.exe $(OBJS) $(LIBS) $(W32CONLIBS)
</PRE></B>
